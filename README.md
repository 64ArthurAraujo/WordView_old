# WordView

Tradução em [português](https://github.com/64ArthurAraujo/WordView/blob/master/README_PTBR.md).



## How it works?

WordView is a application that can help your language learning journey, using audios (mainly music) you can memorize new words by visualizing them as images. The principle is almost the same as of a flashcard, but more interactive.



## How to actually use it

First, download the latest release from [this](https://github.com/64ArthurAraujo/WordView/releases) page for your operating system (`.AppImage` for Linux and `.exe` for Windows)

Open the app and click in the plus button, then give your wordmap a title and click in the 'Open Audio File...' button, and
choose the mp3 of the audio or music that you want to use.


You just created a basic wordmap, the next step is to visually represent the words that are being said in the audio with images, to do that you are going to click in the pen button on top of the wordmap, which is going to bring up the editor.


Here you can play the audio, skip back and forward, and add images. To add a image, play the song until you reach the word that you want to represent and click in the 'Image' button, here you pick a image by clicking in the 'Image...' square and adjust the exact moment that the image is going to show up (i recommend putting the image moments before the word is said).


If you've made a mistake, you can adjust update the location which the image was set, or if you want you can delete it.


Once you are done mapping your audio, you can play only the video by going back to the home and clicking in the wordmap.
